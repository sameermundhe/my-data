        Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language and a computing platform developed
         by Sun Microsystems in 1995, and later acquired by Oracle. 
         It is known for its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) capability, meaning compiled Java code
          can run on any platform that supports Java without recompilation.
